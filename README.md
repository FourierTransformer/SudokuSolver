SudokuSolver
============

A Sudoku Solver using my TableSalt framework

It currently solves the "Top 95" sudoku puzzles found on Peter Norvig's page (http://norvig.com/top95.txt). I may one day come back and write a dynamic parser, and turn it into a web app, but for now - it is what it is.

It's recommended that `luajit` is used to run the code. All you need to do is run the file!

    luajit sudoku.lua
